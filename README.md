## UN and EU approach towards Climate Change

This idea came to me while looking at the Summits and Events organised by the UN and EU in several countries.  
It led me to the question: **Are they focusing these events in countries that really need to reduce their emissions?**  

For the next step I took these 23 Countries (Now called **"Participants"**) and the next 23 Countries in terms of GDP (Called **"Non-Participants"**).
I looked for historical information in terms of Temperature, Population and GDP. You can find several .CSV in the **"Data.rar"** file. 
First I did the comparison between Participants and Non-Participants. Later on, the data took me to reorganise the idea and do a comparison between the 23 with bigger emissions against the 23 with the lowest (all inside the initial groups).  

At the end, I did some hypothesis testing, where I answer to the question "Are richer people in average more contaminating than poorer ones?", by separating in smaller groups by GDP per Capita.
